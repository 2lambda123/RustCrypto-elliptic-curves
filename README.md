# RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves [![Build Status][build-image]][build-link] ![Rust Version][rustc-image]

General purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types
and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points,
and public/secret keys composed thereof.

All curves reside in the separate crates and implemented using traits from
the [`elliptic-curve`](https://docs.rs/elliptic-curve/) crate. Additionally all
crates do not require the standard library (i.e. `no_std` capable) and can be
easily used for bare-metal or WebAssembly programming.

NOTE: Some crates contain field/point arithmetic implementations gated under the
`arithmetic` cargo feature as noted above.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

All crates in this repository support Rust **1.37** or higher. In future minimum
supported Rust version can be changed, but it will be done with the minor
version bump.
