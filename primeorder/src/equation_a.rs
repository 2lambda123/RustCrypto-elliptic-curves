//! Support for formulas specialized to the short Weierstrass equation's
//! 洧눅-coefficient.
//!
//! This module is largely a workaround for things which should be possible
//! to implement more elegantly with future Rust features like
//! `generic_const_exprs` and `impl const Trait`.
//!
//! In absence of such features, we define ZSTs that identify properties of
//! the 洧눅-coefficient which could potentially be written as const expressions
//! on `PrimeCurveParams::EQUATION_A` in the future (including ones which
//! could be used as trait bounds).

/// Sealed trait which identifies special properties of the curve's
/// 洧눅-coefficient.
