//! Support for formulas specialized to the short Weierstrass equation's
//! 洧눅-coefficient.
//!
//! This module is largely a workaround for things which should be possible
//! to implement more elegantly with future Rust features like
//! `generic_const_exprs` and `impl const Trait`.
//!
//! In absence of such features, we define traits that capture properties of
//! the 洧눅-coefficient which could potentially be written as const expressions
//! on `PrimeCurveParams::EQUATION_A` in the future (including ones which
//! could be used as trait bounds).

use super::PrimeCurveParams;

/// The 洧눅-coefficient of the short Weierstrass equation is 0.
pub trait CurveEquationAIsZero: PrimeCurveParams {}

/// The 洧눅-coefficient of the short Weierstrass equation is -3.
pub trait CurveEquationAIsMinusThree: PrimeCurveParams {}

/// The 洧눅-coefficient of the short Weierstrass equation does not have specific
/// properties which allow for an optimized implementation.
pub trait CurveEquationAIsGeneric: PrimeCurveParams {}
