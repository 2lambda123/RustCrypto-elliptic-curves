K-256 elliptic curve (a.k.a. [secp256k1]) types implemented in terms of traits
from the [`elliptic-curve`] crate.

Optionally includes an [`arithmetic`] feature providing scalar and
affine/projective point types with support for constant-time scalar
multiplication, which can be used to implement protocols such as [ECDH].

## About K-256 (secp256k1)

K-256 is a Koblitz curve typically referred to as "[secp256k1]".
The "K-256" name follows NIST notation where P = prime fields,
B = binary fields, and K = Koblitz curves (defined over Fâ‚‚).

The curve is specified as `secp256k1` by Certicom's SECG in
"SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters":

<https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf>

It's primarily notable for usage in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
particularly in conjunction with the
[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA].

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.41** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy
